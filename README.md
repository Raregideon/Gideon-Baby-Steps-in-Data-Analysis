### Problem Statement
The Objective of this project is to improve the profit margin of the depicted Company, and to seek new ways of driving sales of products across selected countries in Europe, Central America, and North America, while reducing the associated Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
To achieve the above, the following questions were asked and Relationships established:
1.	Which product recorded the highest number of sales?
2.	Which product recorded the highest number of sales in each country?
3.	In which country was the highest number of sales recorded and why?
4.	In which segment was the highest number of sales recorded and why?
5.	What product recorded the highest number of sales in each of the segments?
6.	In which month of the year was the highest number of sales recorded and why?
7.	In which year was more sales recorded?
8.	What factors contributed to the sales of products across the countries?
9.	What factors contributed to the lack of sales of the least sold product?

### Data Sourcing
The data used for this project was provided as a case study material in the 30 Days of Learning program, powered by MICROSOFT and championed by @theoyinbooke

### Data Cleaning
Data was cleaned and transformed using pivot tables and the Analyze tool in Microsoft Excel, thereby establishing the relationships in form of tables and charts.

### Findings and Recommendations
1.The Product 'Paseo' recorded the highest number of sales across the countries/regions. This shows that this product has high level of acceptability and usage, hence the company should give priority to the production of PASEO.

2. Canada as a country has high sales potentials as most of the sales of the Paseo product were recorded from here.

3. The 'Government' segment of each country purchased the items more as a result of discounts ranging from 'low' to 'high' availed to the consumers. It is therefore highly recommended that similar discounts be given to other segments, especially the 'small business'. This will further improve sales of products across the regions[Financial Sample.xlsx](https://github.com/Raregideon/Gideon-Baby-Steps-in-Data-Analysis/files/9274262/Financial.Sample.xlsx)
